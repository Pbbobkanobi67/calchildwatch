## Tweet 1 (Main)

🚨 Inspired by @nickshirley's Minnesota investigation, I'm building CalChildWatch—an open-source tool to bring the same transparency to California's childcare system.

58 counties. $1B+ in subsidies. One dashboard.

Here's what we're doing 🧵

---

## Tweet 2

The problem: California spends over $1 billion annually on childcare subsidies, but there's no easy way to see:

• Which facilities receive taxpayer funds
• How much each one gets
• Whether they actually have enrolled children

Nick showed us this works. Let's do it at scale.

## Tweet 3

What we're building:

✅ County-by-county facility database (from state licensing)
✅ Cross-reference with subsidy payments (via public records requests)
✅ Anomaly detection (flagging mismatches)
✅ All open source

## Tweet 4

California's data is fragmented across:

• Community Care Licensing (CCLD) - facility licenses
• Dept of Social Services - CalWORKs childcare
• Dept of Education - state preschool programs
• 58 county agencies

We're pulling it all together.

## Tweet 5

Phase 1 ✅ Done:
- App framework built
- All 58 counties mapped
- Data visualization ready

Phase 2 🔄 In progress:
- San Diego County pilot
- Scraping CCLD database
- Filing CPRA requests for payment data

---

## Tweet 6

The scraper is live. We can now automatically pull:

• Facility names & addresses
• Licensed capacity
• Inspection history
• Violations/citations
• License status

Runs weekly via GitHub Actions. All public data.

## Tweet 7

Next: matching payments to facilities.

I'm filing California Public Records Act requests for:
- CalWORKs childcare payments by provider
- State preschool contract amounts
- Alternative Payment Program disbursements

Will post the templates so anyone can do this for their county.

## Tweet 9

Nick showed that one person with public data can shine a light on billions in potential fraud.

California is 10x the size of Minnesota. We need citizen journalists in every county.

Pick your county. File a records request. Let's go.

## Bonus Tweet (For replies/engagement)

"But Claude, won't this take forever?"

The scraper runs automatically every week.
CPRA requests have a 10-day response deadline.
The app updates on every GitHub push.
